Machine Learning Methods for MicroRNA Gene Prediction MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded, small, noncoding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides in length, which control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through translational inhibition, degradation, adenylation, or destabilization of their target mRNAs. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in various species, many more may still remain unknown.

Machine learning (ML) can consider a higher number and complexity of variables and may be useful for characterising cardiovascular risk, predicting outcomes, and identifying biomarkers in large",disease outcome prediction
"First, we directly applied 23 predictor algorithms (PA) to the datasets to predict year-4 MoCA, which PD patients this year have a higher dementia risk. Subsequently, HMLSs, including 14 attribute extraction and 10 feature selection algorithms followed by PAs were employed to enhance prediction performances. 80% of all datapoints were utilized to select the best model based on minimum mean absolute error (MAE) resulting from 5-fold cross-validation. Subsequently, the remaining 20% was used for hold-out testing of the selected models. Results. When applying PAs without ASAs/FEAs to datasets (MoCA outcome range: [11,30]), Adaboost achieved an MAE of 1.74 +/- 0.29",disease outcome prediction
"as extreme velocity, streaming massive information settings captured from wearables, like fitness bands and biosensor watches. During our paper, we describe a scalable algorithm called Neuron network, which is used to achieve highly accurate results in fuzzy data. We have presented the outcomes of the proposed framework implementation for static and low-velocity/volume settings from the EHR & clinical DBs, with the experimental authentication of the planned framework, for 2 openly accessible CVD data sets which are NHANES dataset, and the Framingham Heart Study dataset), shown promising outcomes, in terms of performance of different modelling algorithms for the disease status prediction.",disease outcome prediction
"motor disability and disease activity. The performance of ML models is discussed along with highlighting the influential MRI-derived biomarkers. Overall, MRI-based ML presents a promising avenue for MS prognosis. However, integration of imaging biomarkers with other multimodal patient data shows great potential for advancing personalized healthcare approaches in MS. Machine-learning-based approach for nonunion prediction following osteoporotic vertebral fractures Purpose An osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) is a common disease that causes disabilities in elderly patients. In particular, patients with nonunion following an OVF often experience severe back pain and require surgical intervention. However, nonunion diagnosis generally takes more than six months.",disease outcome prediction
"prediction models according to the diagnostic steps. Results: Among 1605 enrolled neonates with all-cause cholestasis, 145 (9%) were included as having biliary atresia. Direct bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, abdominal sonography, and hepatobiliary scan were the most impactful features in prediction models. The Step II XGBoost model, consisting of nonimaging inputs, showed excellent discriminatory performance (area under the curve = 0.97). The Step III and IV XGBoost models showed near-perfect performances (area under the curve = 0.998 and 0.999, respectively). In external validation (n = 912 with 118 [12.9%] biliary atresia), XGBoost-based prediction models consistently showed acceptable performances.

"prediction model may provide information regarding functional outcome for clinicians that will help provide appropriate medical care for patients and information for their caregivers. Machine Learning for Outcome Prediction in First-Line Surgery of Prolactinomas BackgroundFirst-line surgery for prolactinomas has gained increasing acceptance, but the indication still remains controversial. Thus, accurate prediction of unfavorable outcomes after upfront surgery in prolactinoma patients is critical for the triage of therapy and for interdisciplinary decision-making. ObjectiveTo evaluate whether contemporary machine learning (ML) methods can facilitate this crucial prediction task in a large cohort of prolactinoma patients with first-line surgery, we investigated the performance of",disease outcome prediction
"increasing interest in machine learning-based prediction models in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]. We synthesised and critically appraised studies comparing machine learning vs traditional statistical models, using routinely available clinical data for risk prediction in IBD. Methods Through a systematic review till January 1, 2021, we identified cohort studies that derived and/or validated machine learning models, based on routinely collected clinical data in patients with IBD, to predict the risk of harbouring or developing adverse clinical outcomes, and reported its predictive performance against a traditional statistical model for the same outcome. We appraised the risk of bias in these studies using",disease outcome prediction
"dimensionality of ML approaches has been demonstrated in studies incorporating diverse input variables including electroencephalography scans, achieving 88% accuracy for treatment response, and cognitive test scores, achieving up to 72% accuracy for treatment response. The predicting response to depression treatment (PReDicT) trial tested ML informed prescribing of antidepressants against standard therapy and found there was both better outcomes for anxiety and functional endpoints despite the algorithm only having a balanced accuracy of 57.5%. Impeding the progress of ML algorithms in psychiatry are pragmatic hurdles, including accuracy, expense, acceptability and comprehensibility, and ethical hurdles, including medicolegal liability, clinical autonomy and data",disease outcome prediction
